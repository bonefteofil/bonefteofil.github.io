# Personal website
As a student passionate about software development, I'm always looking to improve my skills and share my work with the world.
I built this website to serve as my digital portfolio, where I showcase my projects, the tehnologies I've worked with and my overall growth as a developer.
In the contact section, uesrs can find my social and email, while on the projects page, users can explore my work with descriptions, source code links and media previews.

## Tech stack
I used modern web technologies to ensure good performance and future scalability.
- built with React and Vite for a fast and optimized development experience.
- structured with well-thought components with complex properties to ensure reusability and efficiency.
- TypeScript is used for type checking, reducing errors and improves overall code quality.

## Design
The design takes inspiration from retro-style interfaces, featuring sharp corners and a minimalistic aesthetic, but with a modern touch.
- the color palette is composed of shades of gray, with the background gradient in blue and purple.
- icons are from [SVG Repo](https://www.svgrepo.com/) and [Iconfinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/).
- font from google [Jersey 10](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Jersey+10).
