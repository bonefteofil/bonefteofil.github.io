        >
            I developed a simple website app where you can play Tic-Tac-Toe with Ollama using the local API. This project consist of two parts: <br /><br />
            - the chatbot, an interface where you can talk with Ollama (doesn't have history)<br />
            - the game, where you can play Tic-Tac-Toe with Ollama (it's not so smart)<br />
        </ButtonProject>
    );
